This certain topic which will be strongly and continually touched in all aspects of the website are Network Operating systems.
  </br>
  </br>
  </br>
    For our website to be truly effective and manipulate the many segments of the Network Operating systems, there will be many components attached to the main topic of this website. These components which will be fully and powerfully enforced throughout the website will include the support component, security component, user setup component, printing file services component, email component, and common software systems. The foundation of this website will augmentate a particular style of communicating information through a simple way.
  </br>
  </br>
  </br>
    In each page of our website, there will be information being presented which will be further enhanced through images, videos and diagrams. The website will also have easy navigation and therefore allows the audience to understand and interpret the information in a particular way. The information being presented will have many elements to it such as what is the component, how is the component used within the Network Operating systems and many more sub topics which will be used as platforms to understand the main topic of each page.

   The Network Operating system or also known as Network OS is a computer operating system that is designed to primarily to support workstations and personal computers. However, the Network OS also supports older terminals that are usually connected on a Local Area Network(LAN).
</br>
</br>
</br>
   Through these elements in which the Network OS supports, it provides a platform in which many aspects of networking can be fully accessed and used. There are also certain standalone operatings systems such as Microsoft Windows NT which come in multipurpose activities and can also act as a Network OS. Furthermore, Network Operating Systems include special functions for connecting computers and devices in a Local Area Network(LAN).
</br>
</br>
</br>
   In addition these special functions represent the many aspects of networking which are both important and influential in how a Network OS operates. These aspects are well known as the topics for each page of the website which include the support component, security component, user setup component, printing file services component, email component, and common software systems. The capabilities of the Network OS are endless and through a maintained and sustained connection with the LAN, these components of the Network OS is what portrays the Network Systems as a impactful tool to further enforce technology in the everyday lives of individual.
