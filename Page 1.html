  <h1>What is the Support component of the Network OS?</h1>
  <p>
    <img class="image 2" src="Resources/Network Operating System.jpg" alt="Picture".>
    One of the first aspects of the Network OS is the Support component. For a personal device such as a computer or laptop to be effective and provide many features which help individuals. The need of both software and hardware elements are influential in enforcing the main concept of the Network OS which is to connect the individuals to the many characteristics of the network. Furthermore the support component provides the necessary and important support by maintaining and sustaining the connection to many outlets such as processors, applications and hardware devices. These outlets which are strongly connected to the network through the support component will make up the network and reiterate the main purpose of the Network
  OS which is to control the software and hardware running on a network.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
   Furthermore, not only does the support component support the connection the network, however also supports users ability when interacting with the network. For example, the support component also supports the user accessing the network, process requests for specific documents and usage of hardware. Through supporting different aspects of the network, which enhances what the Network OS can do and reinstate the main concept of the Network OS which is to connect individuals to the world of the network through the use of software and hardware. As the support component being one of the most influential component in the Network OS, their effects and impacts are still predominately shown through the many aspects of networking. This is shown as the support component also provides the Network OS with protocol request from users including Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol(TCP/IP) and other protocols.

<h1>How does this component contribute/help the Network Operating System?</h1>

  The Support component which plays an important part in maintaining the many impactful aspects of a Network OS is also a contribution to network in many ways. One of these ways is that the support system help support the connection between hardware devices in the network. In addition, the connection which is needed from the computer to hardware devices such as modem and routers can be maintained and sustained through the support component. Therefore, this allows the Network OS to fulfil its task of enforcing tools of the network to the many individuals.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
  Another way is that that the support system help support the connection is that users have the ability to access the network. With user having the ability of accessing the network, many advantages are evident when this happen. For example, by having users access the network. Many individuals can connect their computers to the network and therefore access the same perks as each other. Furthermore, users that can access the network can do a number of things such as share files, folders and devices with other PCâ€™s and devices which are primarily connect to the Network.
