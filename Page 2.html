  <h1>What is the Security component of the Network OS?</h1>
  <p>
    <img class="image4" src="Resources/Security.jpg" alt="Picture".>
    The second aspect of the Network OS is the Security component. With personal computers acting as an integral part of insidivuslism which allow the computers we use to upholds the necessary privacy. The security component acts as a protector of this by using its very masteries to ensure that personal computers are protected from the malicious intent of breaching personal privacy. In order for the security component to uphold and maintain these standards of protecting the Network OS.
</br>
</br>
</br>
    The Network OS uses the security component to manage authorisation and authentication of users, computer workstations and other devices accessing the Network. Through this the protection of the network is evaluated through the authentication and authorisation which is used as platforms of sustaining an aura of safety for the Network. An example where the security component is evident in the Network is when an intruder tries to access a network.
</br>
</br>
</br>
    If this intruder does not have the ability to access the network through verification and authorisation, this will result in triggering the authorisation and authentication component to be utilized in fixing the problem. Furthermore, the Network OS blocks the unauthorised user/computer and logs the intrusion attempt within its log files. The Security component also entitles the ability for the Network OS to keep users from installing unauthorized software and devices.

<h1>How does the Security component contribute/help the Network Operating System?</h1>
<p>

The Security component contribute/help the Network OS is many ways such as it maintains and acts as a shield in which unauthorised users, files and softwares are monitored in which the protection of the Network is upheld in the Network OS. As the security acts as a protector in which external outlets in which they pose a threat to both the Network and user is a priority in which the Security component is held responsible for.
</br>
</br>
</br>

Furthermore, this act of protection is reflected internally as the Security component has the ability to verify user identity and therefore permits access to the particular user to the Network OS. Therefore, users which are not grant the ability to access the network will be denied access, as the security component will fulfils its goal as to protecting the user by denying access to other users who do not have the same ability of access as the primary user. With networks which have vast amount of users, the Network OS also has the capability to control and monitors these users through the main user.
</br>
</br>
</br>
For example, a computer can have many users attached to it with the main purpose of using it. However only the main user can have the ability to hand out the power to the other users and therefore, due to the lack of power for other users. They are restricted in the functions that are trying to be performed. Therefore, the security component also gives privileges to each user according to how much power they have which corresponds the the amount of functions which they are entitled to.
