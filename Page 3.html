  <h1>What is the User Setup component of the Network OS?</h1>
  <p>
    <img class="image5" src="Resources/User Setup.jpg" alt="Picture".>
    The third component of the Network OS is the User Setup component. This component is a part in which with the security component are influential parts in maintaining the status of a network. The User Setup component links on with the security component as its allows us to correlate the concept of users having the freedom and ability to prosper through the network with their custom settings. The User setup allows the Network to have the ability to create users account. With computers entitled to everyone, users for different individuals is important for online identity and verification as it acts a vital part in maintaining the authentication component of the Network OS.
  </br>
  </br>
  </br>
    By creating users the User Setup component also manages the logging into and out of the network. Also with users come power, and the primary users which have the most access will correlate to how the user setup component works. For example,  a primary users will have the most power and is exposed to more opportunities to access the network, while a secondary user might have less power which will correlate how much access they are entitled to.
  </br>
  </br>
  </br>

    The User setup component also manages what file and directory services a specific user has access to, users accessing the network remotely and how the networkâ€™s graphical interface looks to specific users.
</p>
</br>
</br>


<h1>How does this component contribute/help the Network Operating System?</h1>
<p>
  <img class="image6" src="Resources/User Setup 2.jpg" alt="Picture".>
  The User Setup component contributes and helps the Network Operating System in many ways such as with many users accessing the network. The Security component cannot maintain its position as a protector whose role is to monitor the users and how unrestricted access can lead to the lack of authentication of the user.
</br>
</br>
</br>
  However, for a network to thrive and build they need users. Therefore, through the role of the User Setup component. The network has the capacity to allow many users as well as maintain the access according to how much power they are entitled to. Furthermore not only does this component manage users however they are also evident in file and directory as they control who has the access.
</br>
</br>
</br>
  In addition, with many users a network is able to build without users abusing their power by accessing more files. Also with the User Setup component, it is able to monitor the users logging into and out of the network and therefore, unauthorised access can be dealt with. Also there are different features to each user and specific users gets these special privileges such as more access. From this concept of more access you have the better you can connect to the network also correlates to how each user views their network such as specific users will how different graphical interface looks to other users.
